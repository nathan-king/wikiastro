This is a plain wiki with a simple goal: help you find information quickly and keep it easy to maintain.

## Navigation

- Use the top navigation for the main pages.
- Use the [Library](/library) for wiki articles grouped by category.
- Use the search in your browser (or your editor) if you’re working locally.

## Recommended Structure

When you add new entries, aim for one of these formats:

- **Overview**: a short definition + key points + links out.
- **How-to**: steps, prerequisites, examples, and pitfalls.
- **Reference**: tables, lists, parameters, or canonical details.
- **Glossary**: terms and synonyms.

## Writing Guidelines

- Lead with the simplest explanation that works.
- Prefer bullets, short sections, and descriptive headings.
- Link related topics instead of repeating content.
- If something is incomplete, add a “TODO” section and move on.

## Next Steps

- Browse the [Library](/library).
- Read [Editing & Conventions](/practices) before making larger changes.

## Foundations of Our Cosmology

Our understanding of spirit and presence emerges from three foundational principles:

| Principle         | Role                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Beginning** | Undivided origin—the ground of all presence             |
| **Chaos**         | Boundless potential—space where forms can emerge        |
| **Chronos**       | Flowing time—the unfolding frame of change and sequence |

These principles are not spirits themselves. They do not act. They provide the context in which spirits exist.

## A Framework Rooted in Reason and Reverence

We walk a path that is **both spiritual and grounded**. While we honour mystery, we avoid superstition. Our rituals, stories, and structures are intended to foster awe, connection, and reflection—not control or dogma.

This is not a fixed or closed system. We welcome exploration, dialogue, and personal insight. But if you choose to walk this path, it is important to **work within the framework** it offers. Our spirits are not gods, and our practices are not tools of manipulation. They are part of a symbolic and relational system that centres respect, clarity, and connection.

## The Role of Story and Myth

Story is one of our most powerful tools. We believe that **creating and sharing myth** is a sacred act that allows us to form relationship with the spirits. These stories help us recognise patterns, values, and the presence of spirit in daily life.

Our myths are not literal or superstitious. They are bridges of meaning—ways of seeing the world that awaken reverence and connection.

## In Summary

- The world is alive with spirit, in both vast and intimate forms.
- We honour spirits through ritual, story, presence, and relationship.
- Our tradition is grounded in reason, mutual care, and practical meaning.
- We are one expression of a larger human truth—many paths exist, and all deserve respect.
- If you walk this path, walk it with clarity, care, and commitment.
