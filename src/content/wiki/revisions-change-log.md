summary: How to track changes over time without losing context.

Wikis change. A lightweight revision practice prevents confusion and makes it safe to iterate.

## When to Record a Change

- Renames (titles, categories, major reorganizations)
- Meaning changes (definitions updated, guidance reversed)
- Merges/splits (one page becomes multiple pages)

## Where to Record It

- Add a small “Changelog” section at the bottom of the page.
- Keep entries short and dated.

## Example

```md
## Changelog
- 2026-01-12: Renamed from “X” to “Y”; updated examples.
```
