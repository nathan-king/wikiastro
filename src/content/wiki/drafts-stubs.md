summary: Where to put rough notes and how to mark incomplete pages.

Not everything needs to be polished. This page describes a simple approach to drafts that keeps the wiki usable.

## Draft Notes

If you’re not ready to write a full page:

- Start with a one-paragraph summary.
- Add a short bullet list of what you know.
- Add links to related pages so readers can keep moving.

## Stubs

For a true stub, use this structure:

```md
Summary sentence.

## TODO
- Fill in definition
- Add examples
- Link related topics
```
