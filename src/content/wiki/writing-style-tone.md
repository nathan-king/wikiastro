summary: A simple style guide to keep pages consistent and readable.

The goal is clarity. This is a basic wiki, not a blog—keep things direct and easy to skim.

## Voice

- Prefer plain language.
- Use headings to break up long pages.
- Use bullets and tables where they make scanning easier.

## Page Basics

- Start with a 1–3 sentence summary.
- Define terms on first use.
- Link to related pages instead of duplicating content.

## “TODO” and Stubs

It’s fine to publish incomplete pages. If you do:

- Add a `## TODO` section with 2–5 bullets.
- Link to the most relevant existing pages so the stub is still navigable.
