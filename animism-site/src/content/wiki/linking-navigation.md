summary: How pages connect and how to link between them.
---

This wiki is designed to be navigated by links. A good page is rarely “complete”; it’s useful because it points to the next relevant thing.

## Where Links Go

- **Library articles** live under `/library/...` (for example: `/library/linking-navigation`).
- **Site pages** (like About/Getting Started) live at the root (for example: `/about`).

## Linking Conventions

- Link the first time you mention a key term.
- Prefer linking to one canonical page per topic.
- Use “See also” at the bottom of pages for related topics.

## Useful Link Patterns

- **Definitions**: link the term to a glossary/overview page.
- **How-to steps**: link prerequisites and follow-ups (setup, troubleshooting, reference).
- **Indexes**: link outward; avoid repeating full content.
