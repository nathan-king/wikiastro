title: Great Numas
category: Numas
summary: A brief introduction to some of the main Great Numas
---

In this animist system, the Great Numas are living presences; they do not merely symbolize natural forces, they inhabit them. “Great” here means they cover broad, general domains rather than specific locales or individual ancestors. This list includes only some of the Great Numas; many more may be recognized and honored.

Each Great Numa is tied to one primary nexus, a place or point of concentrated presence where its power is especially clear. Nexuses can be natural (mountaintops, river springs, forests) or created (home or public shrines). To mark and activate a nexus, practitioners draw, carve or adorn with the Numa’s seal, a symbol imbued with its essence.

| Numa    | Domain                |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| Zekos   | Sun / Day             |
| Peia    | Moon / Night          |
| Salo    | Seasons / Time        |
| Yepos   | Sky                   |
| Vana    | Earth                 |
| Sessios | Ocean                 |
| Yra     | Fire / Transformation |
| Hestos  | Wind / Storms         |
| Kames   | Spirit‑Element        |
| Nupia   | Fresh Water           |
| Cyre    | Vegetation            |
| Amma    | Ancestors & Death     |
| Yua     | Dawn                  |
| Sperios | Dusk                  |
| Mione   | Dreams                |

## Natural Nexuses  
- Zekos often gathers at high peaks and open plains at midday, where the daylight is fullest.  
- Peia resides in quiet riverbanks under the moonlight and in coastal coves during high tide.  
- Cyre flourishes in ancient groves and overgrown clearings where new shoots emerge.  
- Mione is strongest in sleeping spaces, shaded alcoves, and beneath the veil of twilight.

## Seals  
Each Great Numa has a unique seal (a simple yet evocative symbol) used to draw its essence into a nexus. Seals are:  
- Used to enshrine a numa within a nexus.  
- Incorporated into shrine designs, pendants or boundary markers.  
- Reinforced through repeated ritual: painting, carving or pressing the seal at the nexus.
