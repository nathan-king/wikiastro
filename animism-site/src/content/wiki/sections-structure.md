summary: How content is organized and where new pages should live.

This site has two kinds of content:

- **Pages** (`src/content/pages`): top-level, curated pages.
- **Library** (`src/content/wiki`): wiki entries browsed at `/library`.

## Adding a New Library Entry

1. Create a new Markdown file in `src/content/wiki/`.
2. Add frontmatter with `title` and `category`.
3. Add links to at least 1–3 related pages.

## Categories

Categories are shown on the Library home page. Keep them broad so they remain useful over time.

Suggested starting categories:

- Basics
- Structure
- Editing
- Reference
