title: About This Site
---

This site is a simple, multi-page wiki: a place to collect notes, definitions, references, and “how-to” pages in a structure that’s easy to browse.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Pages**: evergreen content like “About”, “Getting Started”, and conventions.
- **Library**: the main wiki area, grouped by category and cross-linked.

If you’re new, start with [Getting Started](/beliefs), then browse the [Library](/library).

## How It’s Organized

- Keep topics small and link out to deeper pages.
- Prefer clear titles (“X Overview”, “X Checklist”, “X Reference”) over clever naming.
- Add “See also” links at the bottom of pages to make exploration easy.

## Status

This wiki is intentionally minimal and evolves over time. If something is unclear, add a short note and link to a new page rather than trying to perfect it all at once.
