title: Editing & Conventions
---

This page describes lightweight conventions for adding and maintaining wiki entries. The goal is consistency without making writing feel heavy.

## Page Template

Most pages work well with this structure:

- **Summary**: 1–3 sentences describing what the page is.
- **Details**: bullets, tables, or short paragraphs.
- **Examples** (optional): a concrete example or two.
- **See also**: links to related pages.

## Naming

- Use clear titles (“Caching Overview”, “Writing Checklist”, “API Reference”).
- Avoid internal jargon unless you define it on the page.

## Linking

- Add links when you reference another concept that has (or should have) its own page.
- Prefer one canonical page per topic; link to it rather than duplicating.

## Categories & Tags

Library entries support categories and optional tags. Prefer a small set of stable categories and use tags for finer grouping.

## Maintenance

- If you change page titles, check for broken links.
- If you rename or merge pages, leave a short note in the destination page so readers understand what happened.
